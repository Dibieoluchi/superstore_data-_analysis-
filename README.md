 1.	INTRODUCTION 

A question that bothers every business person regardless of their industry or business size is- “what can be done to improve sales? Analysis solutions help produce insights from data, metrics, and sales patterns. As a result, analyzing sales can help you better known previous sales results and make more informed decisions about market potential, prospects and customers, product lines, and sales team performance this analysis seeks to provide insight to all of this. Running a successful firm requires careful consideration of sales analysis. With the aid of sales analytics, you can choose which goods to prioritize, where to market, and how to effectively connect with buyers. In order to complete my analysis, I must determine whether Sales have increased across all of the variables that have been suggested as having the ability to affect this superstore.
 
2.	BACKGROUND OF STUDY 
This dataset, which belongs to a Superstore Giant in the United States, has 9994 data points in all. It originally had 20 columns, each of which represented the purchase habits of this store's clientele. I used feature engineering to add three more columns to this dataset. With the exception of a few numerical and date/time data types, the majority of this data was of the object data type. Sales trends from 2014 to 2017 were primarily represented by the date time data type.

3.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES 
The aim of this analysis is mainly to determine whether Sales have increased across all of the variables that have been suggested as having the ability to affect this superstore. This analysis has various sub question which it’s going to provide clarity on. This question include   When has this super store made the most sales over the years? Which product categories have made the most sales over the years? Who are you selling the most to? Where do you sell the most? 
Data cleaning: This data included some date objects in the incorrect format that needed to be fixed.
Data manipulation: I categorized my data using the group by functions in Python to make analysis easier.
Feature engineering: from previously existing columns, additional ones were constructed.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualization: insights were produced using graphs plotted with Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

5.	EXPERIMENTS 
I utilize the following predicted factors:
Order Date: I'll use the YEAR column I made from the product's order date.
Segment: The group to which the customer belongs.
State: The customer's home state.
Category: The product's order category.
Using insight generated from this, my analysis answered the following question:

6.	RESULTS AND CONCLUSION 
Have sales increased across all of the suggested variables that could have an impact on this superstore? Yes, that is the response to this question. Between 2016 and 2017, this superstore's sales increased significantly, especially as a result of people buying technical appliances in big quantities. We've found that the majority of this company's clients are individual consumers, most of whom are headquartered in California and have a keen interest in technology. There is a requirement for this product to always be of excellent quality, always available, and enhanced if necessary as a business owner in order to secure more future sales. Even when promoting new technology products, the advertising's content should be tailored to mostly this target audience. Finally, maintain solid customer relations to keep your current clientele and draw in new ones.
